#RPi WS281x Python

This is an unofficial Python distribution of the ws281x library: http://github.com/richardghirst/rpi_ws281x

It's intended to support the Unicorn HAT library, but can be used for driving other WS281x-based LED projects.

###Based Upon rpi_ws281x

`unicornhat` is based upon a modified, Pi 2/3 compatible version of the RPi ws281x Library by Jeremy Garff.

The library was modified by Richard Hirst.
